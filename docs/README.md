# Elara Docs
[Elara](https://github.com/patractlabs/elara) is the infrastructure and network public access service of the Polkadot ecosystem. This project will be connected to the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains, the parachains on them, and the independent chains based on Substrate.

There are dozens of main chains in the current Polkadot ecosystem. With ecological development, more and more main chains and parachains will come online. In order to provide the community with timely and comprehensive access services. Elara will access various mainnet nodes and open API documents as quickly as possible.
Therefore, Elara faces the community and invites all Polkadot ecological project parties, developers and users to jointly build an RPC document warehouse.
